# Lichtenberg Figures

*Currently working on a dielectric breakdown model algorithm. I GOT IT!*

This algorithm was developed in an attempt to best simulate the behaviour of an electric current travelling through an inhomogeneous, insulating material following dielectric breakdown.

The folder **Source Codes (Attempt 1)** contains Python scripts of my first attempt. After working on the single-branch algorithm, I mistakenly implemented depth-first search (DFS) rather than breadth-first search (BFS) for my multi-branch algorithm (I'm no CS major). In the end, my friend Shan Gao helped me develop the final, multi-branch BFS version of this algorithm.

The folder **Animations (Attempt 1)** contains a few selected animations from certain versions of this first algorithm. Unfortunately, the patterns generated by this algorithm appear unphysical and do not at all resemble Lichtenberg figures.

The folder **Source Codes (Attempt 2)** contains Python scripts of my latest attempt. For this attempt, I decided to actually read some papers about diffusion-limited aggregation (DLA) and the dielectric breakdown model (DBM). The papers I used as references are mentioned below. I implemented two different algorithms: the single-tree algorithm and the double-tree algorithm. 

The folder **Animations (Attempt 2)** contains a few selected animations from certain versions of this algorithm. The simulations generated by this algorithm are much more realistic and better resemble Lichtenberg figures.
