# Lichtenberg Figures

This algorithm was developed in an attempt to best simulate the behaviour of an electric current travelling through an inhomogeneous, insulating material following dielectric breakdown.

The Animations folder has a few selected animations (obviously) from certain versions of the algorithm.
The Source Codes folder has \**drumroll\** the source codes of the latest Single Branch Algorithm, DFS Multi-Branch Algorithm, and BFS Multi-Branch Algorithm.
