# Lichtenberg Figures

This algorithm was developed in an attempt to best simulate the behaviour of an electric current travelling through an inhomogeneous, insulating material following dielectric breakdown.

The Animations folder has a few selected animations (obviously) from certain versions of the algorithm.

The Source Codes folder has \**drumroll\** the source codes of the latest Single Branch Algorithm, DFS Multi-Branch Algorithm, and BFS Multi-Branch Algorithm.

## Features

- Create your own custom grids and choose your own starting positions
- Live animations!

That's about it :/

## FAQ

#### Q: Why did you start this project?

A: Because I thought it was cool. Why do people do anything?

#### Q: Your figures don't really look like Lichtenberg figures...

A: I'm working on it :(

#### Q: Have you thought about implementing diffu-

A: Yes I've thought about diffusion-limited aggregation. It's like the first thing you see when you Google "Lichtenberg figure simulations." I don't like it; it's not what I'm going for.
