# Lichtenberg Figures

*Currently working on a dielectric breakdown model algorithm.*

This algorithm was developed in an attempt to best simulate the behaviour of an electric current travelling through an inhomogeneous, insulating material following dielectric breakdown.

The Animations folder has a few selected animations (obviously) from certain versions of the algorithm.

The Source Codes folder has \**drumroll\** the source codes of the latest Single Branch Algorithm, DFS Multi-Branch Algorithm, and BFS Multi-Branch Algorithm.

- Live animations!

That's about it :/

## FAQ

#### Q: Why did you start this project?

A: Because I thought it was cool

#### Q: Your figures don't really look like Lichtenberg figures...

A: I'm working on it :(

#### Q: Have you thought about implementing diffu-

A: Yes I've thought about diffusion-limited aggregation. It's like the first thing you see when you Google "Lichtenberg figure simulations." I don't like it; it's not what I'm going for. 

*(sigh)* It was diffusion-limited aggregation after all.
