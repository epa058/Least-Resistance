# Lichtenberg Figures

*Currently working on a dielectric breakdown model algorithm. I GOT IT*

This algorithm was developed in an attempt to best simulate the behaviour of an electric current travelling through an inhomogeneous, insulating material following dielectric breakdown.

The folder **Source Codes (Attempt 1)** contains Python scripts of my first attempt. After working on the single-branch algorithm, I mistakenly implemented depth-first search rather than breadth-first search for my multi-branch algorithm (cut me some slack I'm no CS major). In the end, my friend Shan Gao helped me develop the final, multi-branch BFS version of this algorithm.

The folder **Animations (Attempt 1)** has a few selected animations from certain versions of this algorithm.

That's about it :/

## FAQ

#### Q: Why did you start this project?

A: Because I thought it was cool

#### Q: Your figures don't really look like Lichtenberg figures...

A: I'm working on it :(

#### Q: Have you thought about implementing diffu-

A: Yes I've thought about diffusion-limited aggregation. It's like the first thing you see when you Google "Lichtenberg figure simulations." I don't like it; it's not what I'm going for. 

*(sigh)* It was diffusion-limited aggregation after all.
